These tests doesn't yet supply a token as a parameter; I'd expect cn-dev to
respond with "Invalid Request" but it returns a "Service Failure" instead for
some things that take a token (but not for others?)

I seemed to have crashed this with multiple runs of my test(?) or, at the very
least, it's just stopped responding

Overall:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These tests are a very simple start and really some of them may even be
insufficient to really tell if a service is really operational.  I didn't build
these out because they are unimplemented in Dryad (and Dryad reports
that) so I didn't have as much control over really testing success/failure
