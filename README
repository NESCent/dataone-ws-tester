DataONE Member Node Web Services Test (version 0.0.1)
===============================================================================

This project is outdated. It has been subsumed by the DataONE Member
Node Tester. 

As of 2013-2-14, the Member Node Tester is available at http://mncheck.test.dataone.org:8080/

===============================================================================
This is a first pass at creating some simple tests through which a DataONE Member Node's
Web services interface can be checked for correctness.  It does not perform a comprehensive
check of the service's functionality at this point, but is a just a first pass at some of the basics.

To install the tests:

1) Install Java JDK 1.6 (or greater)
2) Install Maven 2.1.x (I haven't confirmed this works with Maven 3.x yet)
3) Check out this project using Git
4) In the project directory, type (via a terminal): mvn jetty:run

To run the tests:

1) In your browser, go to http://localhost:9696
2) Enter the URL of the DataONE Member Node you want to test
3) Hit the Submit button
4) View the results of the test

To finish:

1) In the project directory, type Ctrl-C (via a terminal) to stop the Jetty Web server

To add a new test:

1) Create a class that implements org.dataone.wstest.MNTestInterface
2) Add it to the Maven/Jetty classpath (if it's not in the project already)
3) Add its name to the webapp/WEB-INF/tests text file (one class per line)

MetaImplTest is an example of a test that is a little more built out
MonitorPingTest is an example of a test that is more simple/basic
